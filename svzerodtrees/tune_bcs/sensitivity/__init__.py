"""
Sensitivity analysis utilities for structured tree boundary condition parameters.

This subpackage provides helpers to:
    - Build PA configurations with balanced distal resistances.
    - Sweep structured tree parameters (alpha, beta, l_rr, compliance models).
    - Run pysvZeroD simulations and post-process hemodynamic metrics.
    - Persist tabulated sensitivity outputs and companion plots.

See `structured_tree_sensitivity.py` for the primary public entry points.
